                What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming API for HTML and XML documents. It defines the
                    logical
                    structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. In the DOM specification,
                    the
                    term "document" is used in the broad sense - increasingly, XML is being used as a way of
                    representing many
                    different kinds of information that may be stored in diverse systems, and much of this would
                    traditionally
                    be seen as data rather than as documents. Nevertheless, XML presents this data as documents, and the
                    DOM may
                    be used to manage this data.</p>
                <p>With the Document Object Model, programmers can create and build documents, navigate their structure,
                    and
                    add, modify, or delete elements and content. Anything found in an HTML or XML document can be
                    accessed,
                    changed, deleted, or added using the Document Object Model, with a few exceptions - in particular,
                    the DOM
                    interfaces for the internal subset and external subset have not yet been specified.</p>

                How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.

                <p>There are 5 ways in which you can select elements in a DOM using selectors. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>getElementsByTagName()</li>

                What is event bubble?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It happens when an element receives
                    an event, and that event bubbles up (or you can say is transmitted or propagated) to its parent and
                    ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element.</p>

                What is a callback function and why will you use it?

            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>In JavaScript, functions are objects. Can we pass objects to functions as parameters? Yes. So, we can
                    also pass functions as parameters to other functions and call them inside the outer functions.</p>
